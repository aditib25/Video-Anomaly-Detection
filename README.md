This repository includes my work an as Undergraduate Research Intern at Carnegie Mellon University where I worked on advancing video anomaly detection using deep learning. Leveraging Python, PyTorch and computer vision techniques, I analyzed and reproduced methodologies from 5-6 key research papers, ensuring a deep understanding of state-of-the-art techniques. Through extensive experimentation and fine-tuning, I improved the AUC score to 0.85, enhancing the accuracy, robustness, and reliability of anomaly detection systems. This work holds promising applications in surveillance, healthcare, and other safety-critical domains.
